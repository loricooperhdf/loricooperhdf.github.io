# HDF Software Priority Support

Does your organization rely on The HDF Group's popular open-source software products, such as the HDF5 library or HDF5-HSDS? In that case, an annual Priority Support Agreement guarantees you will receive timely support and expert assistance. 

Because everyone's priorities and budget are different, we offer two tiers of priority support. Select what's right for you!
